# MyPortfolio

Here I have started building my portfolio. 
I started by adding all of the HTML 
I then started adding the CSS and fine tuning it based on screen size

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap 
- Font Awesome 
- HTML
- CSS

Note that this is just the CSS and HTML as I move along, I will add more things such as forms and different pages.
